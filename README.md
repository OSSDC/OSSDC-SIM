<h1 align="center">OSSDC SIM: An Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (forked from LGSVL Simulator)</h1>

## As LGSVL Simulator is sunseting on June 30, 2022 (see original LGSVL readme <a href="https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-SIM/blob/release-2021.3/README_LGSVL.md" style="text-decoration: none">here</a>), through this project with help of the community we plan to continue to evolve this amazing work done by LG SVL team, and make it the main open source racing and self driving car simulator integrated with Autoware and Apollo SDC software stacks.

### OSSDC SIM can run independently of SVL Wise cloud, see details in the <a href="https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-SIM-Demos" style="text-decoration: none">OSSDC-SIM-Demos</a> project.

### Soon we will provide a way to save your assets from SVL Wise cloud.
